# Detection and Instance Segmentation of Packet Water Sachets on African Streets
This project aims to build a computer vision model using recent advancements in instance segmentation to
identify improperly disposed water sachets in images. The resulting model from this project can then be
deployed on autonomous robots by governments in African countries to handle the continuously growing
problem of waste PWS management.

The following measurable objectives have been identified:
1. Development of a neural network similar to Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation on Polyethylene
Water Sachets – “SachetNet”.
2. Creation of an Opensource dataset of 300-500 original images of improperly disposed Polyethylene
Water Sachets and 10,000 synthetically generated images of the same.
3. Identification of used PWS on African streets with an accuracy of 80%.
